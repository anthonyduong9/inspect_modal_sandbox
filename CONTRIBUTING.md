## Getting started

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python packaging.

Run this beforehand:

```
uv sync
```

You then can either source the venv with

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

or prefix your pytest (etc.) commands with `uv run ...`

## Tests

Run the tests with `uv run pytest`.

For the tests you will need Modal credentials.

## Linting & Formatting

[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is used for linting and formatting. To run both
checks manually:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

## Type Checking

[Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) is used for type checking. To run type checks
manually:

```bash
mypy
```
